            <p>At deScroll, your privacy is our top priority. We‚Äôre committed to transparency while helping you
                <strong>reduce screentime</strong>, combat <strong>doomscrolling</strong>, and enhance
                <strong>focus</strong> with our <strong>productivity launcher</strong>. üåü deScroll does <strong>not
                    collect, store, or access any of your data on our servers</strong>. All information used by deScroll
                is stored locally on your device as a database and is never transmitted to us. This Privacy Policy
                explains how deScroll handles data locally to provide its features, such as app blocking and usage
                tracking, while keeping your information private and secure.

            <h2>1. Information Processed on Your Device üìä</h2>
            <p>deScroll uses certain permissions to function, but we do <strong>not collect or access any data</strong>.
                Instead, the following information is processed and stored locally on your device:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>üìç Approximate Location (Coarse Location)</strong><br>With your permission via the
                    "Approximate Location" prompt, deScroll uses approximate location (not precise) for location-based
                    features, like personalized app usage insights. This data is stored locally on your device and never
                    accessed by us.</li>
                <li><strong>üì± App Usage Data (Package Usage Stats, Query All Packages)</strong><br>With your consent
                    through the "Usage Access Required" permission, deScroll processes app usage data (e.g., time spent
                    on apps, short video scrolls) to provide insights into your habits and help you <strong>reduce
                        screentime</strong>. We also query installed apps to enable app blocking and usage tracking.
                    This data is stored in a local database on your device and is not transmitted to us.</li>
                <li><strong>üîî Notification Data (Post Notifications, Notification Control)</strong><br>deScroll uses
                    notification permissions to send alerts and updates (with your consent via "Enable Notifications")
                    and to filter or silence app alerts through the "Notification Control" feature. Notification data is
                    processed and stored locally on your device, with no access by deScroll.</li>
                <li><strong>üì≤ Device Information (System Alert Window, Display Over Apps)</strong><br>With your consent
                    via the "Display Over Apps" permission, deScroll uses device information to enable floating widgets
                    (e.g., timers, usage stats) over other apps. This data is processed locally and stored on your
                    device, not accessed by us.</li>
                <li><strong>üö´ App Blocking & Usage Limits (Accessibility Services)</strong><br>Through the "App Blocker
                    Access" and "Usage Blocker Access" permissions, deScroll uses Accessibility Services to block apps
                    and enforce screen time limits. No personal data is collected‚Äîthis feature only restricts apps based
                    on your preferences, and all data stays on your device.</li>
                <li><strong>üîÑ Boot Information (Receive Boot Completed)</strong><br>This permission allows deScroll to
                    restart services (e.g., usage tracking, app blocking) after a device reboot, ensuring uninterrupted
                    functionality. No data is collected or accessed by us.</li>
                <li><strong>üåê Internet Access</strong><br>deScroll uses internet access to fetch app updates, but no
                    personal data is transmitted or collected. All functionality operates locally on your device.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Important</strong>: deScroll does <strong>not</strong> collect precise location, personal
                identifiers (e.g., name, email), or any sensitive information. All data remains on your device and is
                never sent to or accessed by deScroll.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>2. How Data Is Used Locally üîß</h2>
            <p>The data processed by deScroll is used solely to provide its features and is stored locally on your
                device:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>To Reduce Screentime</strong>: Local usage data powers features like "Advanced Insights"
                    (e.g., tracking app activity) and "Usage Guardian" (e.g., setting app time limits), helping you cut
                    screentime by up to 82%, as reported by early users.</li>
                <li><strong>To Block Apps</strong>: Accessibility Services ("App Shield," "App Blocker Access") restrict
                    app access to help you stay focused, with all data processed locally.</li>
                <li><strong>To Enhance Focus</strong>: Features like "Focus Enhancer" and "Notifications Control" use
                    local notification and app data to create a <strong>distraction-free</strong> environment.</li>
                <li><strong>To Personalize Features</strong>: Approximate location and usage data enable tailored
                    features, such as location-based insights, all stored on your device.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>We do not collect, store, or access this data on our servers</strong>, and it is never shared
                with third parties.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>3. Data Security üîí</h2>
            <p>Your data‚Äôs security is ensured by keeping it local:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Local Storage Only</strong>: All data (e.g., usage stats, notifications) is stored in a
                    database on your device, inaccessible to deScroll.</li>
                <li><strong>No Transmission</strong>: We do not transmit your data over the internet or to any servers.
                </li>
                <li><strong>No Third-Party Sharing</strong>: Since we don‚Äôt collect your data, there‚Äôs nothing to share
                    with third parties, even in legal cases.</li>
                <li><strong>Device-Level Protection</strong>: Your data is as secure as your device‚Äîuse strong device
                    security (e.g., PIN, encryption) to protect it.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>4. Permissions & Your Control üéÆ</h2>
            <p>deScroll requires permissions to function, all of which are optional and clearly explained:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Set as Default Launcher</strong>: Enhances your home screen with a <strong>minimalistic
                        interface</strong> for a <strong>distraction-free</strong> experience.</li>
                <li><strong>Expand Status Bar & System Alert Window</strong>: Enables floating widgets for quick access
                    to tools like timers and usage stats.</li>
                <li><strong>Foreground Service (Special Use)</strong>: Runs essential services (e.g., app blocking,
                    usage tracking) in the background for uninterrupted functionality.</li>
                <li><strong>Request Delete Packages</strong>: Allows deScroll to assist in uninstalling apps if you
                    choose to do so.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You can manage these permissions in your device settings. Disabling permissions may limit some features,
                but we respect your choices. Since all data is local, you have full control over it.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>5. Your Rights & Choices ‚öñÔ∏è</h2>
            <p>Since deScroll does not collect data on our servers, your rights are tied to your device:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Access & Deletion</strong>: View your usage data within deScroll (e.g., via "Advanced
                    Insights") and delete it by clearing app data or uninstalling deScroll.</li>
                <li><strong>Opt-Out</strong>: Disable permissions or stop using Accessibility Services to limit data
                    processing on your device.</li>

                </li>
            </ul>
